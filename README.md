### About
stb_rust is Rust port of the famous C framework: [https://github.com/nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)

It is important to note, that this project is **port**, not **wrapper**. Original C code had been ported to Rust. Therefore stb_rust doesnt require any native binaries.

The porting hasn't been done by hand, but using [Ur](https://github.com/rds1983/Ur), which is the C to C# code converter utility.
